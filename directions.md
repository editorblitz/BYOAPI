I want the freedom to generate a lot of different pages without having to organize them on the top bar. there will be too many to fit there. so I'd rather categorize them and have buttons at the top that let the user filter the cards to what they're working on.

1. get rid of Welcome to NGI Data Tools. you can keep the logged in ... etc.

2. Let's put filter buttons at the top. Have four different colors for the cards on the home page so easier for the eye to notice:
Spot Prices
Forwards
LNG
Chart Generators

(unfiltered view, when come to home page, all the cards display as they are now)

And the existing pages are tagged like this:

Spot Prices:
Spot Prices
Spot Prices Dashboard

Forwards:
Forward Prices
Fixed Forward Spreads Dashboard
Forward Curve Spreads Dashboard

LNG:
LNG flows
LNG netbacks

Chart Generators:
Midday charts
Daily Price Charts
